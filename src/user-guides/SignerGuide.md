# Signer Guide

CasperLabs Signer acts as your CSPR wallet, keeping your accounts and letting you sign deploys on the Casper Network to perform actions like staking, unstaking or sending your tokens to another person or an exchange account.

You can create, store and use one or more CSPR accounts on your Signer wallet. All accounts are stored safely in a vault, which is protected by a password you will set when you create it.

## New User (No Accounts)
