_Please note that the Casper Testnet program is implemented by providing rewards
through the [Casper Association](https://casper.network) (CA), a not-for-profit, Switzerland-domiciled organization
responsible for overseeing the Casper network and supporting its organic evolution and continued decentralization.
MAKE Technology LLC is not affiliated with the Casper Association, and has no control over the program sponsorship or the incentivized
reward program, and is hosting these guides and documents as a service to the Casper community only._
