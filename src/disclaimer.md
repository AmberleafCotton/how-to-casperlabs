_Please note that the DEVxDAO's Casper Testnet program is implemented by the [DEVxDAO](https://devxdao.com) by providing rewards 
through the [Emerging Technology Association](https://www.emergingte.ch) (ETA), a Swiss nonprofit association which supports open source 
and transparent scientific research of emerging technologies for community building. 
Any rewards will be granted and calculated by the ETA. MAKE Technology LLC is not affiliated
with the DEVxDAO, the ETA nor the Casper Foundation, and has no control over the program sponsorship or the incentivized
reward program, and is hosting these guides and documents as a service to the DEVxDAO and the Casper community only._
