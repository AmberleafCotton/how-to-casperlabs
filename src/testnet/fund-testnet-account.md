Go to [Testnet CSPR.Live](https://testnet.cspr.live/), and [connect](https://www.casperwallet.io/user-guide/connecting-to-dapps) with the account you want to fund. Click `Tools` from the top navigation menu, then click `Faucet`. Wait for the faucet page to load, and click the `Request tokens` button. Wait until the request transaction succeeds.

> **Note:** If you need more Testnet tokens than provided by the faucet, you can make a request by sending an email to `casper-testnet@make.services` explaining the details of your need.
