Navigate to the default key directory:
```
cd /etc/casper/validator_keys
```
 
And execute the following command to generate the keys:
```
sudo -u casper casper-client keygen .
```

It will create three files in the ```/etc/casper/validator_keys``` directory:

- ```secret_key.pem``` - your private key; never share it with anyone
- ```public_key.pem``` - your public key
- ```public_key_hex``` - hex representation of your public key; copy it to your machine to create an account

Save your keys to a safe place. The public key hex file is used to identify your account when delegators stake their tokens with you or if you are transferring CSPR to this account.
