### Monitor the node status

#### Check the node log

```
sudo tail -fn100 /var/log/casper/casper-node.log /var/log/casper/casper-node.stderr.log
```

#### Check if a known validator sees your node among peers

```
curl -s http://$KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP:8888/status | jq .peers
```

You should see your IP address on the list

#### Check the node status

```
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/status
```

#### Wait for node to catch up
Before you do anything, such as trying to bond as a validator or perform any RPC calls, make sure your node has fully 
caught up with the network. You can recognize this by log entries that tell you that joining has finished, and that the
RPC and REST servers have started:

```
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.577","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"finished joining"},"target":"casper_node::cli"}
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.578","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"started JSON-RPC server","address":"0.0.0.0:7777"},"target":"casper_node::components::rpc_server::http_server"}
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.578","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"started REST server","address":"0.0.0.0:8888"},"target":"casper_node::components::rest_server::http_server"}
```
