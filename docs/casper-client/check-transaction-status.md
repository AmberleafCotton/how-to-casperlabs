Sending a transaction to the network does not mean that the transaction processed successfully. Itâ€™s important to check to see that the contract executed properly:

```
casper-client get-deploy --node-address http://<KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP>:7777 <DEPLOY_HASH> | jq .result.execution_results
```

Replace ```<DEPLOY_HASH>``` with the deploy hash of the transaction you want to check.
