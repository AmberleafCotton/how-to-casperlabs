Sending a transaction to the network does not mean that the transaction processed successfully. Itâ€™s important to check to see that the contract executed properly:

```
casper-client get-deploy --node-address http://<KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP>:7777 <DEPLOY_HASH> | jq .result.execution_results
```

Replace ```<DEPLOY_HASH>``` with the deploy hash of the transaction you want to check.

Run the following script to get known validator IP:

```
KNOWN_ADDRESSES=$(cat /etc/casper/config.toml | grep known_addresses)
grep -oE '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' <<< "$KNOWN_ADDRESSES"
```
