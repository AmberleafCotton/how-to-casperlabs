# Casper Test Net

## Introduction
Participants in the [DEVxDAO](https://devxdao.com) are standing up a Casper Test Net with the following objectives:
* having a permissionless test environment that ecosystem participants can join and use in order to develop, test and tune their tools and 
applications that eventually target the Casper Main Net, without the need for Main Net tokens.
  
* providing the ability for the validator community to install and try out new versions of Casper node software, as well as
  alternative configurations of their nodes and node software, in an environment where things "are allowed to break".
  
* testing and providing access to upcoming protocol and eco-system tool changes, in order to ensure compatibility with existing
applications once said changes deploy to the Casper Main Net. 
  
## Incentivized Participation
The DEVxDAO is inviting interested parties to participate in the Test Net and will offer incentive rewards to Test Net participants. The following
will apply to Incentivized Participation:
1. Rewards will be distributed on the Test Net for a period of time. This will be ratified soon after Test Net is up.
   Everyone will have a *chance* to earn, but not everyone is *guaranteed* to earn rewards.
   
2. Early and solid participation and node operation, as well as adherance to the Code of Conduct below, is the best way to ensure a chance at rewards.

3. Test Net Validators will be scored using an algorithm that uses **uptime** and **liveness** into account, among others. 
   **BEING IN THE TOP RANKS OF VALIDATORS BY STAKE WEIGHT WILL NOT BE A CRITERIA FOR EARNING REWARDS!**

4. There will also be ACTIVE participation rewards for bugs, contests, limitations and other fun things that will be announced periodically as well.

5. Anyone wishing to earn rewards will need to pass KYC and register their Public Key as part of their participation.

## Code of Conduct
It is requested that all adhere to the Code of Conduct below. Adherence is taken into consideration for reward calculation.
1. Join the [Test Net Participants Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/VvtnoteaRVg2ODQx), and be responsive to Admin announcements.
2. Make sure your port 8888 is open to the public. It will be monitored for reward calculation purposes.
3. Once there are 50 or more participants on the network, maintain a stake that is below 3% of the network. There is no benefit to accumulating stake. 
   It is not a reward criteria, and Test Net Tokens have no express or implied value whatsoever. 
4. Stage and participate in node software updates before they are supposed to take effect. This requires being attentive for and responsive to notifications
   in the Telegram channel.
5. If you have to take your node offline, unbond your stake first.
